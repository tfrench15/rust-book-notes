Chapter 1 -- Why Rust?

Zero-cost abstraction: "what you don't use, you don't pay for.  And what you do use,
you couldn't have hand-coded any better yourself."

Systems programming languages (primarily C and C++) have some pitfalls:
    1. they are prone to security vulnerabilities due to memory leaks
    2. concurrent programming is notoriously difficult

Rust eliminates these types of errors through its ownership, borrowing, and move systems.
