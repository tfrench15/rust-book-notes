Chapter 1 -- Getting Started

`$ rustup` to install and update
`$ rustc` to compile a Rust program

`$ cargo new <<PROJECT>>` to create a new PROJECT

fn main() {
    // is the entry point to Rust programs
}

// Hello World
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!")
}

`println!()` is a Rust macro, not a function

`$ cargo build` builds a cargo project 
`$ cargo run` builds and runs a cargo project 
`$ cargo check` checks whether a program compiles (but doesn't build) -- faster compile check!
